# Gravity_sim
Created a python program which uses Newtonian laws of physics, this simulation allows you to experience the fascinating interplay of gravity in a visually engaging and interactive manner.

Made using pygame, you can use simple mouse clicks to launch an object in space and observe its behaviour under gravity.
